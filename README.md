# The-Tech-Academy-Basic-C-Sharp-Projects.-

As a dedicated and curious software developer, I have developed a strong proficiency in C#, using it as a primary tool to understand and apply core programming concepts in real-world scenarios. My journey through C# development has been both practical and concept-driven, allowing me to build a solid foundation in object-oriented programming, efficient code structuring, and modern C# features. This portfolio outlines key technical skills I have acquired and how I have applied them in various projects.

One of the first advanced features I explored in C# was lambda expressions, particularly through building a product inventory management tool. This project involved filtering and sorting lists of products using LINQ and lambda syntax. By using concise expressions like products.Where(p => p.Price > 1000), I was able to reduce the verbosity of traditional loops while making my code easier to read and maintain. This taught me not only the syntax but also the functional programming mindset that modern C# encourages.

Another foundational concept I have worked with is the structure and purpose of the Main method, the entry point of any C# console application. In a task scheduling CLI tool I developed, I practiced clean architecture by keeping the Main() method short and delegating functionality to separate service classes. This design approach improved both scalability and testability of the application. It also gave me practical experience with args[], conditional logic, and project organizationâ€”skills that are essential for building professional-grade software.

I also deepened my understanding of operator assignments through a math quiz engine I created. The game tracked scores and user progress using compound assignment operators like +=, -=, and *=, which simplified the logic within my game loop and made real-time score calculations more efficient. This project helped me appreciate the importance of small syntactical optimizations that contribute to code clarity and performance.

Perhaps the most intellectually rewarding concept I have applied is polymorphism, a core pillar of object-oriented programming. I developed a shape drawing simulator that uses a base Shape class and multiple derived classes such as Circle, Rectangle, and Triangle. Each shape had its own implementation of the Draw() method, and I was able to handle them all uniformly through a list of Shape objects. This approach demonstrated the power of runtime polymorphism and reinforced my understanding of abstraction, inheritance, and method overriding in C#.

In addition to these projects, I have been actively exploring asynchronous programming with async and await, and am currently learning how to develop web applications using ASP.NET Core. I am also experimenting with data access through Entity Framework to create fully functional CRUD applications backed by a database.

Overall, my experience with C# has been defined by a strong grasp of both language features and underlying programming principles. Whether working on academic assignments, personal projects, or collaborative exercises, I strive to write clean, efficient, and maintainable code. I am excited to continue building on this foundation by contributing to meaningful software projects and expanding my skills into broader .NET technologies.
